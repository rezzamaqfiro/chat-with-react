Hi!

This is example chat app using React and Firebase.

## How to start!
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rezzamaqfiro/chat-with-react
$ npm install
$ npm start

open your browser and type http://localhost:3000
input your name then "JOIN"
then you can test multichat by open the link with other page e.g private browser
click the add contact button on the left bottom, then input name already register at the different browser
click the the person list already added
start chat !

fyi, if any process stuck in the middle of running, just refresh the page.
